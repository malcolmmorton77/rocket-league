## rocket-league

The aim of this project is to take in a csv file of data from Rocket League:
Total Score as an integer
Goals as an integer
Assists as an integer
Saves as an integer
Shots as an integer

These datums will be collected on a per person basis, stored as a Menu object.

Thank you to https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/01/30/most-vexing-parse/
for helping me understand how clang and gcc parse parentheses and 
the disambiguation of the parentheses by replacing an object delcaration
with curly braces for initialization{}
